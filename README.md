# Transform3DImage
Transform3DImage is a GUI application for rotating 3D voxel images.
The program reads in a raw voxelfile containing numerical uint8 values,
the user can rotate the image in all directions and then save the new result
into a new raw binary file (uint8).

# Dependencies
In order to run the program the following packages are required:
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* tkinter
* scikit-image
* scipy

# Usage
To launch the program type
```bash
python3 transformImage.py someFile_200_101_150_250.raw
```
Here the numbers indicates:

1. Voxel size
2. Number of voxels in the x-direction
3. Number of voxels in the y-direction
4. Number of voxels in the z-direction

An example file can be generated by running
```bash
python3 generateTestFile.py
```
This creates a file with the filename *exampleFile_200_150_101_200.raw*.
The application can then be testet by
```bash
python3 transformImage.py exampleFile_200_150_101_200.raw
```

The images are rotatet using the scipy-function *scipy.ndimage.rotate* which
utilize splines of cubic order to interpolate the voxel values.
